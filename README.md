# Project Setup

To get started with this project on your local machine, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
- Git (for cloning the repository)
- Node.js (if you plan to use any server-side technologies in the future)

### Steps to Set Up Locally

- Clone the repository:

```shell
 git clone https://github.com/M-Hammad-Faisal/my-automation-site.git
```

- Navigate into the project directory:

```shell
cd my-automation-site
```

- Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser to view the site:

```shell
open index.html
```

(Optional) If you plan to add additional features or server-side functionalities, you can set up a development
environment with Node.js.

### Running the Project

Once the repository is cloned, you can open the index.html file directly in your browser. There is no need for a server
setup if you're just running the frontend files. However, for testing or deploying a more advanced version, consider
using a local server or integrating with cloud functions.

#### Using a Local Server (Optional)

If you want to run a local server for testing, you can use a simple HTTP server like http-server in Node.js.

Install http-server globally:

```shell
npm install -g http-server
```

Run the server:

```shell
http-server
```

Visit http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the site.
